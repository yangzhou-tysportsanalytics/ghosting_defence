"""Train / validation / test split by game and by date (first 80 % of dates train, rest test).

* Games are sorted by date (ties by game id); the first ``train_frac`` of games are the training
  pool, the rest is the test set (later dates -> test, so nothing from the future leaks in).
* Validation games are drawn from the training pool at random (seeded), ``val_frac`` of it.

The split is a function of the *set of games available*, so it is recomputed for every data
config (tiny/small/medium/large) and stored next to the possessions.
